### Answer

* **Application Interceptors**: Added via `addInterceptor()`. They run exactly once, even if the request is served from cache or retried due to connection failure. They observe the final request and response.
* **Network Interceptors**: Added via `addNetworkInterceptor()`. They run on the network layer, observing actual network transmissions (including redirects, retries, and headers). They do not run if the response is cached.
