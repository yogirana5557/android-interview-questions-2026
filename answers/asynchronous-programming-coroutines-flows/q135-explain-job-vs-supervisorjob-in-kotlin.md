### Answer

They differ in how exceptions propagate to sibling tasks:* `Job`: If any child coroutine fails with an exception, the failure cancels the parent job, which automatically cancels all other sibling coroutines in that scope.
* `SupervisorJob`: A failure of one child coroutine does not affect sibling tasks. The supervisor job remains active, enabling individual task failures to be handled locally.
