### Answer

Suspend functions are compiled using the **CPS (Continuation-Passing Style)** transformation. The compiler adds an extra parameter of type `Continuation<T>` to the function arguments. The function is compiled into a state machine. When suspended, the function returns a special token (`COROUTINE_SUSPENDED`), releasing the execution thread. When the work is complete, the continuation's `resumeWith()` is called to restore execution state.
