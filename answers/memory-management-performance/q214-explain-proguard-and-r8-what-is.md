### Answer

Both shrink, optimize, and obfuscate your app's bytecode to reduce APK size and prevent reverse engineering.* **Proguard**: A traditional, separate Java tool used for shrinking.
* **R8**: The default compiler tool integrated into Android Gradle. It performs shrinking, optimization, and obfuscation in a single pass directly from Java bytecode to DEX bytecode, resulting in faster build times and smaller DEX files.
