### Answer

Common causes include:* Passing Activity Context to singleton classes or static variables.
* Keeping references to Views in Fragments after `onDestroyView()`.
* Not canceling Coroutine jobs or RxJava subscriptions when a component is destroyed.
* Non-static inner classes (like Handler or Thread) holding implicit references to the outer Activity.
* Registering listeners/callbacks (like location updates) and forgetting to unregister them.
